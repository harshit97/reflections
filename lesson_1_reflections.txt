How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Umm..I just spotted the typo in the word "space" which was written as "spacr".

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?

I could easily spot my mistakes in the version by quickly comparing it with the old one and hence 
save a lot of time.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving 
multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Don't know.Don't care.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Umm thats what they are there for!

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Even if I break something I could easily go back to the unbroken state.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

ugh.
